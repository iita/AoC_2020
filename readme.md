# Advent of Code 2020
## The quick, the bad, the ugly
### Look ma, I'm a Go developer now

Come all ye faithful, look upon the epitome of "I tried the first approach I could think of and then bruteforced it with if, for, while until it worked *and then I made it worse in a new language*."
This is not my best but also I am no software developer, I look at the data, make do and mend.
